### [Portfolio - Anthony Cross]()

## About

I created this website during July, 2023 with the intention of continuing my knowledge of Next.JS 13 and learning new features that have been added. The portfolio uses Tailwind css for its styling. I used [Realtime Colors](https://realtimecolors.com/) for the theme selection.

I plan on expanding this website to include links to all my currently hosted projects and expanding features out such as project likes, comments, and easy to use blog posting for myself.

## Projects

Currently the projects displayed on the website are:

- Netflix clone project
- ASP.net API example projects written in C#
- We Can do This Todo list web app

## Features

- interactive links and pagination
- Dark Mode
- Components for Navbar and theme handler
- (Coming soon) Project likes / comments
- (coming soon) Easy blog posting features

## Goals of Project

The goal for this project was simple.
Create a easy to use website to display previous work to allow employers to visit and examine.

## Setup
